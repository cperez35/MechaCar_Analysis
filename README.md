# MechaCar_Analysis
This repo contains statistical analysis for MechaCar prototype data.

Deliverable 1 shows a linear regression model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using variables and coefficients. The linear model does not effectively predict mpg.

Deliverable 2 includes summary statistics on suspension coils. The total manufacturing lots meet the design specification for variance of suspension coils below 100 PSI. However, individually, Lot3 does not meet the specification.

Deliverable 3 includes t-tests to determine if manufacturing lots are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 PSI. Lot2 is statistically different while Lot1 and Lot3 are not.

Deliverable 4 proposes a study design to compare MechaCar against competitors based on factors such as cost, highway fuel efficiency, horsepower, maintenance cost, seating capacity, PSI, mpg, ground clearance, fuel type, and safety rating. The design would use a two-sample t-test to compare means and determine if MechaCar differs from competitors.
